program: barcode v0.5
Authors: Roye Rozov, Yaron Einhorn

Usage:   barcode  <command> [options]

Encode command: barcode encode [-v] <prefix> <reference genome> <in.file>
Decode command: barcode decode [-v] <prefix> <reference genome>

Options: -v	verbose mode, control screen output

To print a help message type:
barcode

To recompile program:
make

Requirements:
-You need to have 7-zip installed.
-You need to have Scipy version 0.11.0 (or newer) installed.
-You need to have the appropriate SCALCE compiled file for your operating sysetem: 
 http://sfu-compbio.github.io/scalce/
 	-If SCALCE fails to run & compile, we suggest downloading Zlib (www.zlib.net) 1.2.8 in the scalce directory and compiling it before 
 	compiling scalce 

Miscellaneous:
-Make sure that the executable barcode file, the calc_f.py file and the executable scalce file are in the same folder
-The command for SCALCE and Python are defined in the barcode.h file, and their defaults are defined with the variables SCALCE, and PYTHON 
  with default values of "./scalce" and "python",  if you'd like to change the paths for these commands you can change their defines in the barcode.h file
  and recompile it using make.

Sanity check:
-barcode encode sanity_check data/hg19_samp.fa data/test.fasta
  should result with sanity_check.7z.
  after encode:
  barcode decode sanity_check data/hg19_samp.fa
  should result with a file named sanity_check_decoded_file.txt and it should look like in data/expected_output.fa
